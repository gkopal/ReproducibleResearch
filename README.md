### Recep Arda Kaya - Gamze Kopal - Evrim Bilgen

Original data contain 122 observations we found 22 more.

After inserting and transforming new observations we generated the analysis one more time.

Original survey group from Malaysia, however our new observations are coming from Poland

We beleive that changes between original analysis and our analysis coming from demographical differences.
